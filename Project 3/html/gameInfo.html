                    <p>NBA Jam was initially released in 1993 for the Sega Genesis console. It is the first game in the NBA Jam game series. It is most noted for the announcer saying, 'He's on fire!'.<br /><br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe in-game players are also able to defy physics with their ability to jump several times their own height and dunk a flaming basketball.</p>

                    <p>Released on October 18, 1994, Sonic 3 and Knuckles was a well-received game with over 1 million copies sold.<br /><br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt was intended to be a single game, but was sold as two due to time constraint issues.<br /><br />&nbsp&nbspSonic 3 and Knuckles could actually be 'bridged' in a sense, since the player could use elements from both games using 'Lock-on' technology.</p>

                    <p>This action-packed side-scrolling game was released in 1989. Golden Axe is set in a medieval world where the goal is to find a legendary weapon known as the Golden Axe.<br /><br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe player can use one of three warriors to battle their way to finding the legendary weapon. All three warriors have been greatly affected by the game's nemesis 'Death Adder'.<br /><br />&nbsp&nbspEach warrior is also gifted with their own special kind of magic: the most powerful user would be Tyris, the amazoness.</p>
