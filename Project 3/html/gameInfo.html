                    <p>NBA Jam was initially released in 1993 for the Sega Genesis console. It is the first game in the NBA Jam game series. It is most noted for the announcer saying, 'He's on fire!'.<br /><br />The in-game players are also able to defy physics with their ability to jump several times their own height and dunk a flaming basketball.</p>

                    <p>Released on October 18, 1994, Sonic 3 and Knuckles was a well-received game with over 1 million copies sold.<br />&nbsp&nbspIt was intended to be a single game, but was sold as two due to time constraint issues.<br />&nbsp&nbspSonic 3 and Knuckles could actually be 'bridged' in a sense, since the player could use elements from both games using 'Lock-on' technology.</p>
